## RNN for Hip-Hop Lyric Analysis
The models developed attempt to predict the Billboard ranking of hip-hop songs based on their lyrics.
The project was inspired by the rise of mumble rap, and my love of lyrical rappers like MF DOOM.

Developed using the Keras framework.
Lyrics and rankings were respectively scraped from Genius and Billboard
Libraries used: keras, sqlite3, scipy, numpy, nltk, bs4
